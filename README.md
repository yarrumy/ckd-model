# ckd-model
Model that predicts CKD in patients.

# Overview 
The dataset contains information from 500 patients and includes 30 variables related to CKD. Various machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, and Decision Trees, are applied to develop predictive models for CKD.

# Features 
**Data Analysis**: Processed and analyzed data to identify patterns and correlations.
**Model Development**: Utilized machine learning techniques to build predictive models for CKD. 
**Accuracy**: Achieved an accuracy rate of 88% in predicting CKD, enabling early detection and intervention for at-risk patients.
